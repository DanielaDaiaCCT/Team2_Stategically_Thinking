# Team2_Stategically_Thinking

We were tasked with finding a topic that interested us as a team; from there, we were to create a business model and come up with a hypothesis or question to which we would need to find the answers. After several meetings, we realised that company reviews were an interesting subject. 
As it is known, ratings and reviews are vital for any product or service acquisition. While ratings have only been around for about two decades, it’s hard to imagine shopping, for example, without them. According to consumer research conducted on over 30,000 global shoppers, most (88%) of shoppers use reviews to discover, evaluate and buy products or services.
This study aims to show witch factors are important to an employee to choose a company by using the data set: “Company_Reviews” available at Kaggle and the code is on Google Collab
